Disclaimer: every girl is different. These apply more to young women, but I've seen it in women well out of college too.

* She says compliments like, "Hey, I like your shirt." If she keeps walking, no go. If she stays to chat? Stop, talk to her and get her phone number. She's attracted to you. It's a common piece of dating advice in women's magazines to say something like that to guys. The problem is, men assume the girl likes their clothes, not likes them.

* She asks for your opinion on what kinds of girls you like, what clothes you think looks sexy on them, hairstyles, etc. Bonus if she sends you pics of herself in various outfits. Green flag: you tell her, and she dresses that way the next time you see her. Or she changes her hairstyle if you said you liked a girl's hair down. If she doesn't change fashion but her friend does, she was a wingwoman to gather info for her friend to date you.

* She comes up with excuses to hang out together alone, e.g. homework, studying, working on a project, etc. But she spends more time flirting with you than talking about the task at hand. You're supposed to flirt back and escalate physically. Green flag if you're not even in the same classes or she does not need help studying, i.e. she already knows the material.

* She asks you to help her with easy stuff. Key is she's over-the-top grateful and doesn't want you to leave.

* She's always "around." When you arrive at class, when you leave class, at the coffee shop you like, when you're at an event, etc.

* She's gotten off work and has no reason to stay. You're the reason she wants to stay. If she's at work but says when she gets off work--she wants to hang out with you after.

* She preemptively mentions being single or she's alone (like at an event). Or that she's broken up with her boyfriend. Bigger sign: if she's with a friend and the friend jokes about her having a "boyfriend," she'll immediately blurt out something like, "No! I don't have a boyfriend!" She corrects her immediately because she wants you to know she's available.

* She gives you her phone number without you even asking for it. Or she gets your number from someone else.

* She finds out you're into some hobby, cause or interest. She asks you more and more questions and finally asks for your number. Bonus points is if she asks you to teach her, especially one-on-one. "Teach me" usually means, "Demonstrate your skill and sweep me off my feet."

* She brings up a movie she wants to see, a bar or restaurant she wants to check out, a party that's happening, etc. Especially if she says, "But I have no one to go with" while looking at you. She wants you to ask her out on a date. Variation: she says she'll be there and hopes you volunteer to go too. If she's bold--or tired of you missing out on previous hints--she will ask you out directly.

* A shy girl's stealth way of asking you out is to casually bring up events, and gauge your reaction. "The music department is having a 'Battle of the Bands' competition on Friday." "Oh that's cool! What time and where?" "It's on Friday at 7:00 p.m. at the auditorium. Let's go together. Meet me at my dorm at 6:00 and we can grab food beforehand." "Sure, okay." [4 hours later that night] "Wait, did she ask me out on a date?"

* "Reminder" date, e.g. "When are you gonna take me for a spin in your car?" "When are we going to watch that TV show at your place?"

* Consistent contact. Calls, texts, likes all your posts on Facebook, sends you pics, etc. Key thing: when you do invite her to hang out in person, she does, and she's eager to. If she constantly flakes, she just enjoys your attention and doesn't want to escalate further. If she acts like this with you while in a relationship with someone else, stay away.

* She shares songs, photos, quotes, videos, stories etc. with you related to love. It's a "test" to see if you think about her in those ways.

* "Third Party Endorsement." When she expresses what she wants as if it was the opinion of other people. Saying things like: "My friends think we would make a cute couple." "My Mom asked if you're my boyfriend yet 'cuz we hang out together so much." "Since we're alone together in your room, the other people at the party probably think we're hooking up right now."

* Hypothetical: "There's this girl that likes a guy but she doesn't know if he likes her." She's the girl. You're the guy.

* Touching, hugging, sitting on your lap, holds your hand, puts your arm around her, pulls you onto the dance floor (and dances close), etc. Asks "Have you been working out?" and feeling your biceps or abs. Massages and back rubs (takes off top). Play fighting. Play punches > punch back > escalate to tickle fighting > rolling around on the floor wrestling > you win, but she distracts you by kissing you and you're both making out.

* She complains about being cold. If you're outside, put your arms around her. If you're lying down watching TV together, cuddle closer. If she says her hands are cold, hold her hands.

* She shows off her body. Bends forward to show you her chest or butt, shows off her legs, answers the door wearing little clothing (or a towel). She's really trying if she tells you to look at her dress, legs, etc. "Look how short my skirt is!" Or she invites you to touch. "I just used a new razor to shave my legs and they're so smooth. Come and feel!" "Can you unzip my dress?" "Un-hook by bra?" "See my piercing/tattoo?"

* She finds excuses to remove clothes. Too hot, has to take a shower, change clothes. Key is she doesn't move to another room or close the door or kick you out.

* She "steals" something from you--like a hat. You're supposed to chase her into a room and make out. Or takes a small item from you and drops it down her top. License to feel her up.

* She "forgets" things at your place so she has a reason to come back--and hook up.

* If you get sick or injured, she gets more worried and concerned beyond what you think a normal friend would. If she comes over with food and other supplies and plays nurse, it's a big hint.

* She jumps at an excuse to get in your car--like a beer run--and doesn't want to get out.

* This happens more often in big cities. But after a night out at a bar, nightclub, or party, when she's ready to leave she asks to split a taxi with you back to her place. And she doesn't mentions sharing a cab with the whole group of friends, just you.

* If she has a party at her place, at the end she shoos out all the other guests but wants you to stay. She'll say you're too drunk, your home is too far, weather is too bad for you to drive home now, and she insists you sleep over.

* She "misses" the last train, bus, etc. so she can sleep over.

* She brings up sleeping arrangements. She doesn't want you to sleep on the couch (or floor), and insists you share a bed with her.

* She mentions how she's home alone tonight, roommate is away, her parents out of town, etc. She wants you to invite yourself over to fool around. Or for you to ask her to come over to your place. Hot tip: text her "coming over" or "come over" and see how she reacts. If it's positive, it's on. If it's negative, it's not. Especially if this is late at night or early in the morning, booty call hours.

* Expressing thirst: "I'm so horny!" "I need to get laid tonight" "It's been so long" "I've never fucked in [location you're both in now]."

* She kisses another girl in front of you--and wants you to watch. Invites you into a room to fool around more. How threesomes start. She thinks: if girl-on-girl doesn't turn him on, he's gay. Guy thinks: she's kissing a girl. She's gay.

* She asks you out. She's tired of hinting. Straight talk is the last resort.

* She says she used to have a crush on you. If she's single, she could be hinting she still has a crush and you should ask her out. He gets hung up on how she used the past tense, and treats it as her saying, "I'm not interested in you now."

Negative tactics. Some girls do these things to attract guys, but they actually repel guys.

* She tries to make you jealous. She brags about guys asking her out, flirts with guys in front of you but always looks at you to make sure you see it, etc. She wants to let you know she's "in demand" so you'll want her. The problem is girls are turned on by competition in relationships, while most guys are turned off.

* Complain about guys hitting on her. What she sometimes means is, "I don't like it when other guys do it, but it's okay for you because I like you." This backfires, because the guy will assume the girl doesn't want him to make a move too.

* She bad-mouths any girl you date, because she's jealous of them getting to be intimate with you.

* She opens the conversation by insulting you. house_robot explained this really well in another thread.

Quote:

> When a girl says, "Oh you're a player aren't you?" its similar to when they say shit like, "Oh you want me to go home with you? You sure you don't have other girls there already?"

> Its the female approach to giving a man a compliment: passive aggressively, and couched as an insult. Shes letting you know you have desirable qualities.

> When girls say this type of nonsense to you, never confirm or deny it.

It took me a while to realize this was a thing. I'd meet a new girl, she'd break my balls, and I'd be turned off. Hear later she liked me. WTF?

Let's end on a positive note.

* Food (+1 if she cooked or baked it herself), gifts, handmade greeting cards, mixtapes, poems or stories she wrote that are about love she wants you to read, etc. Unless she does these for other friends, she's already dreamed about the wedding.

Good luck!
