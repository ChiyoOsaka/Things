* You're on the same team, be together like you want each other to win.
* If you find yourself and your partner beginning to have a fight, ask yourselves if you're hungry or tired (edit: or dehydrated or horny). If you are, fix that and resume the fight later.
* It's ok not to like each other sometimes. It passes.
* I can't remember where I read this, but it was something along the lines of viewing a relationship like the buddy system you had in school. Check on your buddy. Make sure they don't forget their lunchbox. Hold hands with your buddy so they don't get lost. If your buddy wants to look at the monkeys, look at the goddamn monkeys with them. If you're the one looking at the monkeys, ask your buddy what they want to do next and if they want to feed the zebras. Help your buddy find a quarter for the food dispenser. Be a good buddy, and if your buddy isn't good to you, ask your teacher for a new one.
* Don't stop dating after getting married. I should clarify: dating each other
* Just had a regular customer come in to get some work done. We got to chatting and she said "If you and your boyfriend are ever in an argument, hold his hand. It's impossible to be mad while you two are touching, and you can more easily discuss the issue you are having." She said she had been married to her husband for 50 years, and any time they had had an argument, he would hold her hand and it would calm her down (after initially being super pissed off because she knew exactly what he was doing).
* Never emotionally invest in someone who you feel does not reciprocate.
* Be with somebody who is the first one you want to tell good news to
* If someone wants to leave you, just let them. Don't fight to keep them by your side.
* its Give AND Take. Too much of either isnt good
* Never move in with your mother in law
* It's not me vs. you. It's us vs. the problem.
* One that I know will be controversial: If your spouse/partner says, "Is something wrong?", if you value honesty, you have to answer truthfully. Don't say, "NO....." (passive-aggressively) Say, "Yes, but I can't discuss it right now." Or: "Not really, sorry, am I coming off grumpy?" If you do discuss it later, you should start off with, "Thanks for noticing that I was upset."  And don't penalize the person if they kept doing the thing that was bothering you after they asked if something was wrong (and you didn't specify what it was). No one is a mind reader.
* Keep the fights clean and the sex dirty
* "We have to stick together, because these kids are trying to kill us." - My husband (source: we have two year old twin boys).
* "Never make someone a priority while allowing yourself to be an option."
* Getting counseling doesn't mean you've failed at your relationship. It means you care about it enough to make it the best it can be.
* My bf and i pretty much have a rule that we don't withhold affection just cause we're angry. The actual rule is that we're allowed to touch each other's butt at any time.
* If your spouse has had a bad day and needs to vent - ask them before: "Do you want me to try and come up with a solution to this problem or do you just want to vent to a friendly ear?"
* More advice that I'm giving. Me and my partner have been together for ages now and one thing that consistently works is the use of Rock Paper Scissors. Essentially there are a million little shitty jobs that need to be done but not on the list so to make it fair we just play Rock Paper Scissors. I swear the amount of arguments it has saved is unreal
* Whenever you want to do something even remotely questionable, always ask yourself "if SO did this to me, would I like it?". If your answer is "no", chances are they wouldn't like it either.
* A good friend of mine said simply, no name calling. You can say you're being a bitch/asshole. But when you start saying you ARE.. That's labeling someone you love as something bad.
* A highly intellectual and thought-provoking man once told me, "Don't save her. She don't wanna be saved."
* Before you get married, that's the time when you and your spouse are trying to impress each other. If you date someone who treats you like scum at the beginning, then chances are once you get married that isn't going to improve.
* Never speak ill of your husband to your mother or sisters. You'll forgive him, they won't.
